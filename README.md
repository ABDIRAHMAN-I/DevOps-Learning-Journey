# DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning repository! This repository is designed to track my progress as I navigate through various modules of this DevOps bootcamp. It will serve as a central hub for all my notes, labs, and project work. 



## About this repository 

This repository is organized into multiple modules, each representing a core area of DevOps. You will find a dedicated folder for each module where I have stored my notes, labs, and any other relevant materials.

## How I’m Organizing This Repository

This repository serves as the core of my learning journey. Here’s how I maintain it for maximum efficiency and growth:

- **Consistent Progress Tracking:** I regularly commit updates to document my learning milestones, key takeaways, and any roadblocks I’ve overcome.
- **Structured Learning Materials:** Each section is neatly organized with dedicated folders for detailed notes, practical labs, and project files to reinforce my understanding.
- **Hands-On Learning Approach:** To truly grasp each concept, I create small-scale projects that allow me to apply and experiment with the knowledge I’ve gained.
